# sprocket_central_prospect_targeting
This project was done to help a company identify whom of 1000 prospects to target advertising efforts to, based on insight from current clientele transaction and demographic data analysis

Presented with the task of helping a bike parts sales company to identify who to target from a list of 1000 prospects for maximum value, I set off by first exploring the provided current clientele transaction and demographic data, spotting quality issues, and suggesting ways that they are fixed.

From the typical M, Male, MALE gender inconsistency, to singular products having more than one product ID, the original data was in summary, a mess. 

After intensive cleaning, I materialized an action plan to relay to the client, seeking approval before diving into EDA.

Here, I identified the 4 demographics that contributed greatest to a customer's value to the company, in terms of total revenue brought in, one being that customers aged between 37 and 43 were more likely than any other age bracket to make a purchase.

I then used this information to classify prospective targets for the company, to enable them to know how to distribute marketing resources. After building a dashboard conveying the importance of these metrics, I built a rule-based propensity-like model to rank prospective customers from highest potential value to lowest, based on their combination of these identified demographics, to make easy the company's ability to target specific numbers of people.
